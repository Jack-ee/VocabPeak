generate_audio_pack.py - VocabPeak pre-generated pronunciation pack builder.

Reads a word list, synthesises each word with OpenAI TTS in several voices,
and emits a single bundled pack file. Built to run as a GitHub Action so the
OpenAI key lives only in an encrypted Action secret and never reaches the app.

Generation is incremental. The previous pack is downloaded from the GitHub
Release and reused as the state store, so each run synthesises only the
(word, voice) pairs that are not already present. Adding a voice makes every
existing word missing that voice, so the next run backfills it automatically.

The voices to synthesise come from a "# voices: ..." header line in the word
list when one is present, otherwise from the VOICES default below. The VocabPeak
app writes that header when it exports a word list, so voices are chosen in
the app UI rather than edited here.

PACK FORMAT (.empack, version 1)
--------------------------------
The pack is a single binary file. No base64, no zip, no client library.

  bytes  0..7    ASCII magic, exactly  b"EMPACK1\\x00"
  bytes  8..11   uint32 little-endian  = manifest length M, in bytes
  bytes 12..12+M UTF-8 JSON manifest (see below)
  bytes 12+M..   raw audio payload; every clip's MP3 bytes concatenated

The manifest is a JSON object:

  {
    "format"   : "empack",
    "version"  : 1,
    "generation": 3,                       integer, +1 each run that adds clips
    "createdAt": "2026-05-26T08:00:00Z",
    "model"    : "gpt-4o-mini-tts",
    "voices"   : ["alloy", "nova", "fable"],
    "clipCount": 1287,
    "clips"    : [
      { "word": "ubiquitous", "voice": "alloy", "gen": 1,
        "offset": 0, "length": 8421 },
      ...
    ]
  }

"offset" and "length" locate a clip's MP3 bytes inside the audio payload,
relative to the start of the payload (i.e. relative to byte 12+M of the file).
"word" is always lowercased. The app keys its IndexedDB store by
voice + "|" + word, mirroring the existing hsv-tts cache key shape.

Parsing the pack in the browser is a few lines:

  const buf  = await response.arrayBuffer();
  const dv   = new DataView(buf);
  const mLen = dv.getUint32(8, true);
  const manifest = JSON.parse(
      new TextDecoder().decode(new Uint8Array(buf, 12, mLen)));
  const dataStart = 12 + mLen;
  for (const c of manifest.clips) {
      const slice = buf.slice(dataStart + c.offset,
                              dataStart + c.offset + c.length);
      const blob  = new Blob([slice], { type: "audio/mpeg" });
      // store blob under `${c.voice}|${c.word}`
  }

OUTPUT FILES (written to tools/dist/)
-------------------------------------
  vocabpeak-audio-pack.empack          full pack, every word x every voice
  vocabpeak-audio-pack.delta.empack    only clips added in this run (this gen)
  vocabpeak-audio-pack.manifest.json   the full pack manifest alone, no audio

The manifest file is tiny; the app can fetch it first to learn coverage and
the current generation before deciding whether to download the full pack.

USAGE
-----
  python tools/generate_audio_pack.py            real run (needs OPENAI_API_KEY)
  python tools/generate_audio_pack.py --dry-run  list missing clips, no API calls
  python tools/generate_audio_pack.py --selftest build+parse a pack with fake
                                                 audio; verifies the format only
  python tools/generate_audio_pack.py --limit 20 cap words synthesised this run
  python tools/generate_audio_pack.py --range 51-100  build only word indices
                                                 51..100 (the word list, when
                                                 exported from the app, tags
                                                 each word with a stable index;
                                                 a "# range:" header does the
                                                 same and the CLI flag overrides it)
  python tools/generate_audio_pack.py --extract  unpack the built pack into
                                                 individual MP3 files to listen

# entry (an example sentence or a definition) is synthesised in only
# LONG_ENTRY_VOICES voice(s): those clips are several times larger, are
# heard far less often than a drilled word, and voice variety across a
# whole sentence is barely noticeable — so paying 4x the bytes for it is
