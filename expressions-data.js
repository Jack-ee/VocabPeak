/**
 * Expression Coach Data — Native English Phrasing Patterns
 *
 * Categories:
 *   requesting   — Directing action, giving instructions
 *   suggesting   — Proposing ideas, recommending approaches
 *   evaluating   — Critiquing, giving feedback, assessing quality
 *   explaining   — Providing reasoning, contextualizing decisions
 *   scoping      — Consolidating, narrowing focus, setting boundaries
 *   workflow     — Directing multi-step processes, coordinating tasks
 *
 * Each entry supports three exercise types:
 *   fill-blank  — blanks[] array, answer is expr
 *   scenario    — options[] array, index 0 is always correct
 *   rephrase    — rephrase string is the "clumsy" prompt; expr is target
 *
 * To add a new expression: append to EXPRESSIONS array, assign next id.

// full set. The Ref tab (PHRASING_BANK in speaking-coach.js) is
// generic reference material and is shared with everyone unchanged.
